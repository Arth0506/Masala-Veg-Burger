Pour some vegetable oil onto a pan and turn on the gas.
Once the pan is hot (At least 130 degrees F), put on your veggie patty and let it fry, and keep the burger buns on the pan and let them toast
OPTIONAL: You can also choose to fry your onions and tomatoes
Once the buns are brownish-black on the bottom, take them off and apply ranch and mayonaise to the buns
Flip the burger patty once it is brownish-black and a little scarred on the bottom and let it fry
Once the burger patty is fried, put it on the bottom burger bun, and add cheese, lettuce, onion, and tomatoes and finish it off with your choice of masala and put on the other burger bun and gently press the burger down
Put your toothpick through the middle (optional) and enjoy!
